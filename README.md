# 🧠 Tweets Sentiment Analysis Using Data Engineering Pipeline

**Team 12 — Data Engineering Project**  
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using a robust data engineering pipeline, integrating data scraping, processing, and machine learning for classification and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This end-to-end system captures tweets in real-time, processes them, and applies sentiment analysis using both rule-based and machine learning approaches. The workflow includes:

- **Tweet Scraping**
- **Scheduled Data Ingestion**
- **Data Storage & Cleaning**
- **Text Preprocessing (Lowercasing, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Sentiment Labeling with TextBlob**
- **Vectorization (Unigram, Bigram, Trigram)**
- **Model Training (Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes)**
- **Visual Analytics (Word Clouds, Polarity Distribution, Length Variation)**

---

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Uses the `ntscraper` Twitter scraper (Nitter backend) to collect tweet data.
   - Scraped data is saved to `.json` files and converted to `.csv` for processing.
   - Ingestion is scheduled using `APScheduler` (every 24 hrs).

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Remove mentions, hashtags, punctuations, emojis.
   - Lowercase transformation.
   - Stopword removal using NLTK.
   - Lemmatization for consistency.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Polarity & subjectivity using TextBlob.
   - Tweet length & tokenization.
   - Vectorization with `CountVectorizer`.

4. **Modeling:**  
   - Sentiment classification using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
   - Labels: `-1 = Negative`, `0 = Neutral`, `1 = Positive`.

5. **Visualization:**  
   - Word clouds for positive, neutral, and negative tweets.
   - Frequency plots for common words.
   - Tweet length vs sentiment histogram.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `ntscraper`, `APScheduler`, `nltk`, `textblob`, `gensim`
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`
- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes

---

## 📊 Results

- Achieved **~95% accuracy** with Logistic Regression using n-gram features.
- Successfully extracted and classified over **110,000+ tweets**.
- Real-time ingestion ready for automation.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Deploy the pipeline to the cloud (e.g., AWS Lambda or GCP Cloud Functions).
- Integrate a frontend dashboard (Streamlit or Flask).
- Use more advanced models like BERT or RoBERTa for deeper sentiment understanding.
- Add real-time trend analysis (hot topics, hashtag movements).
- Enhance multi-language support.
